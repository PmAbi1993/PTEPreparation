# Advanced Sentence Formation

## Types of Clauses

| Clause Type | Description | Can Stand Alone? |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Independent Clause | Forms a simple sentence | Yes |
| Dependent Clause | Cannot stand alone, needs another sentence to complete it | No |

## Sentence Types

1. **Simple Sentence**: Contains one independent clause
2. **Compound Sentence**: Combines two or more independent clauses
3. **Complex Sentence**: Combines an independent clause with one or more dependent clauses

## Conjunctions

### Coordination Conjunctions (FANBOYS)

Used to connect independent clauses in compound sentences:

- For
- And
- Nor
- But
- Or
- Yet
- So

### Subordinate Conjunctions

Create dependency in complex sentences. Examples:
- Who
- Which
- That
- If
- Even though
- Although

## Sentence Formation Rules

1. **Compound Sentences**: 
   - Structure: [Independent Clause] + [Coordination Conjunction] + [Independent Clause]
   - Always use a comma before the coordination conjunction

2. **Complex Sentences**:
   - Structure: [Independent Clause] + [Dependent Clause] OR [Dependent Clause] + [Independent Clause]
   - Use a comma after the dependent clause if it starts the sentence

## Examples

1. **Simple Sentence** (Independent Clause):
   - The cat sleeps on the windowsill.

2. **Compound Sentence**:
   - The sun was shining, and the birds were singing.

3. **Complex Sentence** (Dependent Clause First):
   - Because it was raining, we cancelled the picnic.

4. **Complex Sentence** (Independent Clause First):
   - We cancelled the picnic because it was raining.

5. **Compound Sentence with FANBOYS**:
   - I love coffee, but I don't drink it after 6 PM.

6. **Complex Sentence with Subordinate Conjunction**:
   - Although he studied hard, he didn't pass the exam.

7. **Compound-Complex Sentence**:
   - The movie was boring, so we left early, which disappointed our friends.

8. **Simple Sentence with Compound Subject**:
   - John and Mary went to the store.

9. **Complex Sentence with Multiple Dependent Clauses**:
   - When the alarm went off, which was earlier than usual, I reluctantly got out of bed.

10. **Compound Sentence with Three Independent Clauses**:
    - The sun rose, the birds sang, and the day began.

## Important Notes

1. **Always use FANBOYS to connect independent clauses** to avoid run-on sentences.
   - **Incorrect**: The weather was beautiful we decided to go for a walk.
   - **Correct**: The weather was beautiful, **so** we decided to go for a walk.

2. **Place a comma before coordination conjunctions** in compound sentences.
   - **Incorrect**: I wanted to go to the party but I had too much homework.
   - **Correct**: I wanted to go to the party**,** but I had too much homework.

3. In complex sentences, **use a comma after the dependent clause** if it starts the sentence.
   - **With comma**: **Although** it was late, we continued working on the project.
   - **Without comma**: We continued working on the project **although** it was late.

4. A sentence is considered **independent if you can put a full stop at the end** and it makes sense on its own.
   - Independent: The sun set behind the mountains. (Complete thought)
   - Dependent: While the sun set behind the mountains. (Incomplete thought)

5. **Avoid sentence fragments** by ensuring each sentence has at least one independent clause.
   - **Fragment**: Because it was raining heavily.
   - **Complete**: Because it was raining heavily, we stayed indoors.

6. **Use subordinate conjunctions to show relationships** between ideas in complex sentences.
   - **Simple relationship**: I stayed home. It was raining.
   - **Complex relationship**: I stayed home **because** it was raining.

7. **Vary sentence structures** to make your writing more engaging.
   - **Monotonous**: I woke up. I ate breakfast. I went to work.
   - **Varied**: After I woke up and ate breakfast, I went to work.

8. **Be cautious with comma splices**, which occur when two independent clauses are joined by only a comma.
   - **Incorrect**: The movie ended, we left the theater.
   - **Correct**: The movie ended, **and** we left the theater.

9. **Use semicolons judiciously** to join closely related independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction.
   - Example: The project was challenging**;** however, we completed it on time.

10. **Ensure subject-verb agreement** in all types of sentences, especially those with compound subjects.
    - **Incorrect**: The book and its sequels was very popular.
    - **Correct**: The book and its sequels **were** very popular.

Remember, mastering these structures will improve your writing in various contexts, including summarizing texts and academic writing. **Practice regularly** to internalize these rules and improve your sentence construction skills.
